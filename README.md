Registration Form Using HTML, PHP, and SQL
This project demonstrates the implementation of a registration form using HTML for front-end layout, PHP for server-side scripting, and SQL for database interaction. The registration form collects user information such as first name, last name, email, and password, and stores it in a MySQL database.
